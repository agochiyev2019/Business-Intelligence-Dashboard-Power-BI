📊 Business Intelligence Dashboard – Power BI
🔎 Project Overview
This project is an interactive Business Intelligence dashboard built in Power BI.
I developed it while completing the “Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence” course on Udemy, applying the concepts I learned to create a professional, end-to-end BI solution.
The dashboard transforms raw business data into actionable insights for sales, profitability, returns, customer performance, and regional trends. It allows decision-makers to track KPIs, drill down by product or region, and identify growth opportunities.
🎯 Objectives
Track company-wide KPIs (Sales, Profit, Margin %, Return Rate, Customers).
Compare regional sales performance across territories.
Analyze product-level profitability and customer segmentation.
Measure the impact of returns on overall performance.
Provide a clear, executive-ready dashboard for business insights.
🛠️ Tools & Skills Used
Power BI Desktop – data visualization & dashboard design
Power Query (ETL) – data cleaning and transformations
Data Modeling – star schema (facts and dimensions)
DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – calculated measures and KPIs
Business Analytics – sales analysis, customer segmentation, return analysis
🗂️ Data Model
Designed a star schema with fact and dimension tables:
Fact Tables: Sales, Returns
Dimensions: Products, Customers, Territories, Calendar
📈 Dashboard Pages
Executive Dashboard – KPIs (Sales, Profit, Margin %, Return Rate), trends, and breakdowns.
Regional Map – sales and profit by geography.
Product Details – margin %, return rates, and category trends.
Customer Details – revenue per customer, segmentation, retention.
Advanced Analytics – Decomposition Tree and Key Influencers to explain drivers of profit and return rates.
📑 Key Insights
Certain regions consistently outperformed others in both sales and profitability.
Some product categories had high revenue but weak profit margins, pointing to pricing or cost issues.
Returns were concentrated in a few categories, significantly impacting margins.
A small group of high-value customers contributed disproportionately to total revenue.
